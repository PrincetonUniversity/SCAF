# SCAF: Speculation-Aware Collaborative Dependence Analysis Framework

Note that the full implementation of SCAF is not yet integrated in this repo. The speculation modules along with some other functionalities are missing.

The novelty, design, implementation, and evaluation of this work is described in the PLDI '20 paper by Apostolakis et al. titled "SCAF: A Speculation-Aware Dependence Analysis Framework"

This work builds upon CAF (CGO '17 by Johnson et al.).
