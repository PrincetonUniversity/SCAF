## SCAF: A Speculation-Aware Collaborative Dependence Analysis Framework

SCAF is an innovative dependence analysis framework that combines in a modular fashion memory analyses and (optionally) speculative assertions.

### Notice
The full implementation of SCAF is not yet integrated in this repository. The speculation modules along with a few other components are missing. All the currectly available memory analysis modules are included though.

### Publications
The novelty, design, implementation, and evaluation of this work is described in the PLDI '20 paper by Apostolakis et al. titled "SCAF: A Speculation-Aware Dependence Analysis Framework" ([ACM DL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3385412.3386028)).

To reproduce the evaluation results presented in the PLDI 2020 paper, please refer to the artifact of the paper: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3751586.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3751586)

This work builds upon CAF (CGO '17 by Johnson et al., [ACM DL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3049832.3049849)).

### Prerequisites
LLVM 9.0.1

### Build SCAF
To build and install SCAF, run from the repository root directory: `make`

Run `make clean` from the root directory to clean the repository.

Run `make uninstall` from the root directory to uninstall SCAF.

### Configuration
SCAF is customizable and can be used as a conservative memory analysis if the speculation modules are disabled.
